/**
 * <p>
 * A piped local search consists of a composition of other local search \(S_1, ..., S_n\). These local searches
 * are consecutively executed in a pipeline where the best solution found by search \(S_i, i \le 1 \lt n,\) is
 * used as initial solution for search \(S_{i+1}\). The initial solution of search \(S_1\) corresponds to the
 * initial solution that has been set for the piped local search, if any; else, \(S_1\) starts from a randomly
 * generated solution. The best solution obtained after executing the entire pipeline is eventually returned as
 * the global best solution of the piped search.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This search is a single step search, meaning that execution of the entire pipeline is considered to be one
 * step of the piped search and that the global algorithm terminates when this step has completed. Moreover, a
 * piped local search can be started only once. After its single step has completed, the search will automatically
 * dispose itself together with all contained local searches.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Only searches solving the same problem as the one specified when creating the piped local search can be included
 * in the pipeline.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When a piped local search is requested to stop, this request is propagated to the searches included in the pipeline.
 * Similarly, when a piped local search is disposed, all searches in the pipeline are also disposed.
 * </p>
 * 
 * @param <SolutionType> solution type of the problems that may be solved using this search, required to extend {@link Solution}
