/**
 * <p>
 * Variable neighbourhood descent algorithm. In every search step, all neighbours of the current solution are generated
 * using the k-th neighbourhood (initially, k = 0). The best neighbour is identified and accepted as the new current
 * solution if it is an improvement. Else, k is increased by 1 so that the next neighbourhood will be used in the next
 * step. Whenever an improvement is found, k is reset to 0. When k becomes equal to the number of available neighbourhoods,
 * the search stops, as none of the neighbourhoods contains an improvement.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Good results are often obtained by providing (preferably disjoint) neighbourhoods ordered by increasing size. Then,
 * only the smallest neighbourhood is extensively used, which will reduce computational costs, while larger neighbourhoods
 * offer ways to escape from local optima where necessary.
