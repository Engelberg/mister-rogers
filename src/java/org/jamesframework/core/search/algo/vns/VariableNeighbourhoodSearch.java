/**
 * <p>
 * Variable neighbourhood search (VNS) algorithm. This search applies a series of neighbourhoods for random 
 * shaking of the current solution in combination with an arbitrary other local search algorithm L to modify
 * the solution obtained after shaking, in an attempt to find a global improvement. More precisely, given a
 * series of \(n_s\) shaking neighbourhoods \(N_i, i=0, ..., n_s-1\) and an arbitrary other local search
 * algorithm \(L\), each step of VNS consists of:
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 *  <li>
 *   <b>Shaking</b>: sample a random neighbour \(x'\) of the current solution \(x\), using shaking
 *   neighbourhood \(N_s\) (initially, \(s = 0\)).
 *  </li>
 *  <li>
 *   <b>Local search</b>: apply algorithm \(L\) with \(x'\) as its initial solution, until it terminates.
 *   The best solution found by \(L\) is referred to as \(x''\).
 *  </li>
 *  <li>
 *   <b>Acceptance</b>: if \(x''\) is a valid improvement over \(x\) it is accepted as the new current
 *   solution and \(s\) is reset to 0. Else, \(x\) remains the current solution and \(s\) is increased
 *   by one, so that the next shaking neighbourhood will be applied in the next step. If \(s\) becomes
 *   equal to the number of shaking neighbourhoods \(n_s\), it is cyclically reset to 0. Therefore, VNS
 *   never terminates internally but continues until a stop criterion is met.
 *  </li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * By default, VNS applies variable neighbourhood descent (VND) as the local search algorithm L used to modify
 * \(x'\). The list of neighbourhoods of VND is not required to be related to the shaking neighbourhoods of VNS.
 * As VND is computationally intensive (it generates all neighbours in the current neighbourhood in every step),
 * smaller neighbourhoods are often applied for VND compared to the shaking neighbourhoods of VNS. The latter may
 * grow larger without computational concerns as they are only used for random sampling.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * It is possible to use any other local search algorithm \(L\), by specifying a custom neighbourhood search factory.
 * In every step, a fresh instance of \(L\) is created to be applied to solution \(x'\); afterwards, this instance is
 * disposed. Usually, an algorithm is applied that terminates internally at some point in time (VND, steepest descent,
 * ...). Alternatively, a never ending algorithm may be applied in combination with some stop criterion (e.g. random
 * descent with a maximum runtime).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The combination of shaking and local search is considered to be one move in the VNS algorithm, which is only accepted
 * if it yields a global improvement. Therefore, {@link #getNumAcceptedMoves()} and {@link #getNumRejectedMoves()}
 * reflect the number of times that such complex move has been accepted and rejected, respectively.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that {@link #getNeighbourhoods()} returns the list of shaking neighbourhoods applied by VNS, which are, in
 * general, unrelated to the neighbourhoods applied by the default VND local search algorithm. All internals of the
 * applied local search algorithm \(L\) are shielded inside this algorithm, i.e. the algorithm is simply applied as
 * a black box to transform a given solution \(x'\) into another solution \(x''\).
 * </p>
