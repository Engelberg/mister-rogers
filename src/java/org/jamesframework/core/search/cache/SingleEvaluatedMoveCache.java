/**
 * A single move cache only stores the last evaluation and validation that were offered to the cache.
 * Any previously cached value is immediately discarded and replaced with the new value. In general,
 * most neighbourhood searches select a single candidate move (random, best, ...) from the neighbourhood
 * in every step and then just decide whether or not to apply it to the current solution. Therefore, a
 * single move cache can be used to effectively cache the evaluation and validation of this candidate
 * move with minor memory overhead.
 * <p>
 * This is the default cache of any neighbourhood search.
