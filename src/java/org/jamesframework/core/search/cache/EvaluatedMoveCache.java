/**
 * Interface of a cache that stores validations (see {@link Problem#validate(Solution)}) and
 * evaluations (see {@link Problem#evaluate(Solution)}) of neighbours obtained by applying moves
 * to the current solution in a neighbourhood search. Whenever a move is validated and evaluated, the
 * computed values may be presented to the cache. They can be retrieved later, when the same move is
 * validated or evaluated again for the same current solution, if these value are still contained
 * in the cache at that time.
 * <p>
 * In general, there is no guarantee that cached values will still be available at any later
 * point in time. Every cache implementation may handle cache requests in a specific way, and may
 * store a different number and/or specific selection of values. The only guarantee is that if a
 * value is retrieved from the cache, it will be correct.
 * <p>
 * When the current solution of a neighbourhood search is modified, any move cache used by this
 * search should be cleared using {@link #clear()} as then the cache is no longer valid.
 * <p>
 * Note that when using a cache implementation that stores multiple values, it may be beneficial
 * to override {@link Object#equals(Object)} and {@link Object#hashCode()} in the moves generated
 * by the applied neighbourhood, to increase the probability of a cache hit.
