/**
 * <p>
 * Interface of a solution validation produced by a problem definition. The only requirement is that the
 * validation object can be converted into a boolean value that indicates whether the solution is valid
 * (see {@link #passed()}). A predefined simple implementation is provided that merely wraps
 * a boolean value (see {@link SimpleValidation}).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When implementing custom delta validations, the validation of the current solution of a neighbourhood
 * search is passed back to the problem to validate a move. Knowing only whether the current solution is
 * valid or not might not be sufficient to efficiently validate the modified solution. In such case,
 * custom validation objects can be designed that keep track of any additional metadata used for
 * efficient delta validation.
