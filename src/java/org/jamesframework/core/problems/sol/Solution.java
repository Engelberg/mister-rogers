/**
 * Represents an abstract solution. Every extending solution type is required to provide appropriate implementations
 * of {@link #equals(Object)} and {@link #hashCode()} that compare solutions by value (instead of reference) and
 * compute consistent hash codes, respectively. The default implementations inherited from {@link Object} have been
 * erased and replaced with abstract methods without implementation.
 * <p>
 * Every solution class should also implement the abstract method {@link #copy()} which is used to create a deep
 * copy of a solution. The returned deep copy should <b>always</b> have the exact same type as the solution on which
 * the method was called. A static method {@link #checkedCopy(Solution)} is provided to create type safe copies of
 * any solution: it returns a deep copy of the exact same type as its argument, given that the general contract
 * of {@link #copy()} is followed in every solution type implementation. If this contract is violated, calling
 * {@link #checkedCopy(Solution)} will throw a detailed exception that precisely indicates the cause of the
 * occurred type mismatch.
