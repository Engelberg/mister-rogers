/**
 * <p>
 * Interface of a solution evaluation produced by a problem definition. The only requirement is that the
 * evaluation object can be converted into a double value that expresses the solution quality by
 * calling {@link #getValue()}. A predefined simple implementation is provided that merely wraps
 * a double value (see {@link SimpleEvaluation}).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When implementing custom delta evaluations, the evaluation of the current solution of a neighbourhood
 * search is passed back to the problem to evaluate a move. Knowing only the double value of the current
 * solution's evaluation might not be sufficient to efficiently evaluate the modified solution. In such
 * case, custom evaluation objects can be designed that keep track of any additional metadata used for
 * efficient delta evaluation.
