/**
 * <p>
 * A subset neighbourhood that generates deletion moves only (see {@link DeletionMove}). A deletion move is a subtype
 * of {@link SubsetMove} that removes a single ID from the selection of a subset solution. If desired, a set of fixed
 * IDs can be provided which are not allowed to be removed from the selection. Also, a size limit can be imposed so that
 * no moves are generated when the current solution has minimum size.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that this neighbourhood is thread-safe: it can be safely used to concurrently generate moves in different
 * searches running in separate threads.
