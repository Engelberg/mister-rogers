/**
 * <p>
 * A subset neighbourhood that generates moves which simultaneously add up to \(k\) items to the selection,
 * where \(k\) is specified at construction (or unlimited). Generated moves are of type {@link GeneralSubsetMove},
 * which is a subtype of {@link SubsetMove}, and always only add IDs to the selection. If desired, a set of
 * fixed IDs can be provided which are not allowed to be added. Also, a size limit can be imposed so that
 * it is guaranteed that the subset solution will not exceed this size after application of a move generated
 * by this neighbourhood.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that a very large amount of moves may be generated when the dataset size increases. Therefore, this
 * advanced neighbourhood should be used with care, especially in combination with searches that inspect
 * all moves in every step. Furthermore, searches that inspect random moves may have few chances to find an
 * improvement in case of a huge amount of possible neighbours.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This neighbourhood is thread-safe: it can be safely used to concurrently generate moves in different searches
 * running in separate threads.
 * </p>
