# mister-rogers

Mister Rogers is currently a work-in-progress. The aim is to implement local neighborhood search algorithms in Clojure. The protocols are inspired by the JAMES framework in Java. At this time, I am undecided whether to implement this as native Clojure, or whether to wrap JAMES functionality. I will probably explore and benchmark both approaches before deciding.
